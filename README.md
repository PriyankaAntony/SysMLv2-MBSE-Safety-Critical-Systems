## Project Overview
This repository contains the implementation and modelling artefacts developed for my Master’s thesis titled:
**“Systematic Modelling of Safety-Critical Systems Using SysML V2”**
The research investigates how SysML V2 improves Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) practices compared to SysML V1, particularly for complex safety-critical aerospace systems.
A High Altitude Platform (HAP) case study is used to demonstrate structured system modelling using the Magic Grid methodology.

## Case Study: High Altitude Platform (HAP Alpha)
The system model represents a stratospheric unmanned aerial platform inspired by DLR’s HAP Alpha concept. It captures the architecture and behaviour of a solar-powered high-altitude system designed for long-endurance missions in the lower stratosphere. The model integrates key subsystems including the solar energy generation unit, battery storage, flight structure, communication subsystem, payload components, and ground station interaction.

The modelling addresses:
- Stakeholder needs  
- System requirements  
- Functional decomposition  
- Structural architecture  
- Behaviour modelling (State Machines & Activities)  
- Parametric analysis (mass & power calculations)  
- Verification and analysis cases

## Research Objectives
The primary objective of this thesis is to investigate how SysML V2 can be systematically applied to the modelling of complex safety-critical systems within a Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) framework.
The research aims to:
- Develop a structured system model of a High Altitude Platform (HAP) using SysML V2
- Apply the MBSE Magic Grid methodology across multiple abstraction levels
- Evaluate the formal separation of definition and usage in improving model precision and reuse
- Analyse variability and configuration modelling capabilities
- Assess traceability between stakeholder needs, system requirements, structure, behaviour, and parameters
- Demonstrate executable parametric modelling for engineering analysis
- Investigate view and viewpoint mechanisms for stakeholder-specific system representation
- Compare SysML V2 with SysML V1 in terms of semantic clarity, scalability, and methodological support
- Evaluate the suitability of SysML V2 for safety-critical aerospace system development
Through this investigation, the thesis provides both a practical implementation and a methodological assessment of SysML V2 within a structured MBSE workflow.

##  Methodology
The modelling approach follows the MBSE Magic Grid framework.
The system is structured across abstraction levels:
- Problem Domain (Black-box / White-box)
- Solution Domain
- Component & Implementation Level
Each level is analysed across the four modelling pillars:
- Requirements modelling
- Structural architecture modelling
- Behaviour modelling
- Parametric modelling and analysis

# Tooling Environment
The models were developed using:
- SysML V2 textual notation
- Jupyter-based SysML V2 pilot implementation
- SysON graphical visualization
- Docker-based environment setup
This setup ensures reproducibility, modularity, and integration of textual and graphical modelling.

## 🔬 Advanced SysML V2 Capabilities Demonstrated
This thesis demonstrates a comprehensive and structured application of SysML V2 within the MBSE Magic Grid framework. The implementation showcases both language-level innovations and methodological scaling across abstraction layers.
Key capabilities include:
- Formal Definition & Usage separation enabling reusable modelling constructs
- Systematic variability modelling with variation definitions, usage, and configuration views
- Individuals and time-based snapshots for lifecycle and state evolution modelling
- Analysis and verification cases with executable parametric evaluation
- Integrated parametric modelling for mass and power calculations
- Measures of Effectiveness (MoE) linked to stakeholder and safety requirements
- View and viewpoint modelling with concern-driven filtering and metadata annotations
- Logical subsystem decomposition using ports and flow-based interconnections
- State machine and action-based behavioural modelling
- Structured traceability across Black-Box, White-Box, and Solution layers
- Scalable mapping of SysML V2 artefacts into the MBSE Magic Grid
- Textual modelling using SysML V2 pilot implementation (Jupyter-based workflow)
Together, these capabilities demonstrate how SysML V2 enhances precision, reuse, traceability, and safety-oriented modelling for complex aerospace systems.
